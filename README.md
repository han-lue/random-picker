# Random Tab Picker - Chrome Extension

This is a simple higher or lower game where you guess which book stayed longer in The New York Times Best Seller List between 1931-2023.

You can install the extension here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/random-tab-picker/kdoafmhlaphhaemmojbjdmeeibgjkihd?authuser=2 
If you prefer installing and using the extension locally, you can download the repository as zip and upload it to chrome://extensions/ using "Load unpacked". For this to work you need to turn on the developer mode.
